# Voxel World + Mob System - Current Status

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Voxel World System
- **Threading**: Enabled threaded terrain and mesh generation
- **Chunk Management**: Dynamic loading/unloading around player
- **Seamless Terrain**: Fixed seams between chunks with neighbor mesh regeneration
- **Performance**: Multi-threaded generation with 4 terrain + 4 mesh threads
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging system writing to project `logs/` directory

### 2. Mob System
- **SphericalMob**: Physics-based mob with 5 AI behaviors (WANDER, SEEK_PLAYER, FLEE_PLAYER, FLOCK, AGGRESSIVE)
- **SimpleMobSpawner**: Population management with configurable spawn rates and limits
- **SimpleMobInteractionSystem**: Handles terrain/player/mob interactions with wind effects
- **Debug Integration**: Real-time statistics and controls in DebugUI

### 3. Player Controller
- **Movement**: WASD movement with mouse look
- **Edit Mode**: Toggle with T, place/remove voxels, cycle voxel types with R
- **Visual Feedback**: Edit sphere indicator showing placement position
- **Action System**: Organized input handling with debug information

### 4. Input System
- **Complete Input Map**: Added all required input actions (ui_1, ui_2, etc.)
- **Debug Controls**: Number keys 1-5 for mob behavior changes
- **Arrow Keys**: Wind direction control
- **Special Keys**: Enter (spawn aggressive), Space (spawn flock), End (explosion)

### 5. Debug UI
- **System Statistics**: Chunk counts, mob statistics, threading status
- **Real-time Info**: Player position, FPS, mob behaviors, wind effects
- **Interactive Controls**: Keyboard shortcuts for testing mob systems
- **Performance Monitoring**: Thread activity, generation queues

## 🔧 Recent Fixes

### Script Errors Fixed
- **VoxelWorld**: Fixed `chunk.get()` calls to use `chunk.get_meta()` properly
- **PlayerController**: Updated `rim_amount` to `rim` for Godot 4.4 compatibility
- **Input Map**: Added missing UI input actions to prevent debug control errors

### Performance Improvements
- **Threading**: Enabled `enable_threading = true` for faster chunk generation
- **Neighbor Updates**: Automatic mesh regeneration for seamless chunk boundaries
- **Stuck Chunk Detection**: Force generation for chunks waiting too long

## 🎮 Controls

### Basic Movement
- **WASD**: Move around
- **Mouse**: Look around
- **Space**: Jump
- **Escape**: Release/capture mouse cursor

### Edit Mode
- **T**: Toggle edit mode
- **R**: Cycle voxel type (Grass, Dirt, Stone, Ore)
- **Left Click**: Place voxel (in edit mode)
- **Right Click**: Remove voxel (in edit mode)

### Debug/Mob Controls
- **1-5**: Change all mob behaviors (1=Wander, 2=Seek, 3=Flee, 4=Flock, 5=Aggressive)
- **Enter**: Spawn aggressive mob near player
- **Space** (alternative): Spawn flock of 3 mobs
- **Arrow Keys**: Set wind direction (North/South/East/West)
- **End**: Create explosion effect at player position

## 📊 Current Performance
- **Chunk Generation**: 4 threaded terrain workers + 4 mesh workers
- **Render Distance**: 4 chunks (configurable)
- **Threading**: Fully enabled and working properly
- **FPS**: Stable performance with threaded generation
- **Logging**: Detailed file logging + console summaries
