# Player Action System Implementation

## Overview
The player action system has been successfully implemented using a simplified inline approach that avoids class dependency issues while providing organized input handling.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **PlayerController Enhanced**
   - Added `movement_input: Vector3` for action-driven movement
   - Added `action_system: Dictionary` for tracking available actions
   - Added `_setup_action_system()` for initialization
   - Added `_execute_actions()` for centralized input processing

2. **Action Categories**
   - **Movement Actions**: move_forward, move_backward, move_left, move_right
   - **Jump Action**: jump (with ground detection)
   - **Edit Mode Actions**: toggle_edit_mode, place_voxel, remove_voxel, cycle_voxel_type

### Key Features

1. **Camera-Relative Movement**
   - Movement directions are calculated relative to camera orientation
   - Horizontal-only movement (Y-axis filtered out)
   - Smooth input accumulation for diagonal movement

2. **Context-Aware Actions**
   - Edit mode actions only execute when edit mode is active
   - Jump only works when player is on the floor
   - Real-time action state feedback in debug UI

3. **Clean Input Separation**
   - Mouse look handling in `_input()`
   - Action execution in `_physics_process()`
   - Movement application in `handle_movement()`

### Action System Benefits

1. **Organized Input Handling**
   - All input logic centralized in `_execute_actions()`
   - Clear separation between input detection and movement application
   - Easy to add new actions or modify existing ones

2. **Better Maintainability**
   - Single location for all input mappings
   - Consistent pattern for all action types
   - Helper methods for complex actions

3. **Debug Integration**
   - Real-time action state display
   - Movement input vector visualization
   - Edit mode and voxel type feedback

### Usage Example

```gdscript
# Movement actions automatically accumulate in movement_input
# Jump action directly modifies velocity.y
# Edit actions call specific helper methods

func _execute_actions(_delta: float):
    # Movement actions
    if Input.is_action_pressed("move_forward"):
        var forward = camera_basis * Vector3.FORWARD
        forward.y = 0
        movement_input += forward.normalized()
    
    # Jump action with ground check
    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("jump") and is_on_floor():
        velocity.y = jump_velocity
    
    # Context-aware edit actions
    if edit_mode and Input.is_action_just_pressed("place_voxel"):
        _handle_voxel_placement()
```

## Alternative Implementation Available

While the current implementation uses a simplified inline approach, a full object-oriented action system is also available in the `scripts/actions/` directory with these classes:

- `PlayerAction` (base class)
- `MovementAction` (camera-relative movement)
- `JumpAction` (ground-checked jumping)
- `EditModeAction` (mode toggling)
- `VoxelPlaceAction` / `VoxelRemoveAction` (world editing)
- `VoxelTypeCycleAction` (material selection)
- `PlayerActionManager` (coordination)

This OOP approach provides more flexibility for complex projects but requires careful dependency management in Godot.

## Controls

- **WASD**: Movement (camera-relative)
- **Space**: Jump
- **T**: Toggle edit mode
- **Left Click**: Place voxel (edit mode)
- **Right Click**: Remove voxel (edit mode)
- **G**: Cycle voxel type (edit mode)
- **Escape**: Toggle mouse capture

## Debug Information

The debug UI now shows:
- Current movement input vector
- Action system status
- Real-time input state indicators
- Edit mode status and selected voxel type

This implementation provides a solid foundation for expanding the action system while maintaining clean, maintainable code.
